    <p>In my one year at Design for America, I participated in Re:Dsgn at UCSD. We focused on bringing design thinking to underserved elementary and middle school children. Our goal is to teach design as a critical thinking skill to children who are less likely to be exposed to design. In this year long project, I worked on creating an online design course for 4th graders. Due to the pandemic, the teamâ€™s in person teaching material and format made it impossible to teach not in person. As a team, we created an online course written for 4th graders to take asynchronously. I was responsible for creating the module for the reframe lesson. After creating that, I modified the asynchronous model to be online synchronously and tested it with 3 4th graders. Given information the teacher told us, we kept the course to 5 weeks. We tested a lesson weekly and got feedback from the children.</p>
